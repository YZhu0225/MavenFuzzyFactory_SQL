/*
With gsearch doing well and the site performing better, we launched a second paid search channel, bsearch, around August 22.
Can you pull weekly trended session volume since then and compare to gsearch nonbrand so I can get a sense for how important this will be for the business?
*/




/*
I’d like to learn more about the bsearch nonbrand campaign. Could you please pull the percentage of traffic coming on Mobile, and compare that to gsearch? Feel free 
to dig around and share anything else you find interesting. Aggregate data since August 22nd is great, no need to show trending at this point.
*/




/*
I’m wondering if bsearch nonbrand should have the same bids as gsearch. Could you pull nonbrand conversion rates from session to order for gsearch and bsearch, and slice the 
data by device type? Please analyze data from August 22 to September 18; we ran a special pre-holiday campaign for gsearch starting on September 19th, so the data after that isn’t fair game.
*/




/*
Based on your last analysis, we bid down bsearch nonbrand on December 2nd.
Can you pull weekly session volume for gsearch and bsearch nonbrand, broken down by device, since November 4th?
If you can include a comparison metric to show bsearch as a percent of gsearch for each device, that would be great too.
*/




/*
A potential investor is asking if we’re building any momentum with our brand or if we’ll need to keep relying on paid traffic.
Could you pull organic search, direct type in, and paid brand search sessions by month, and show those sessions as a % of paid search nonbrand?
