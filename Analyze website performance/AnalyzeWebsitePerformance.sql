Could you help me get my head around the site by pulling the most-viewed website pages, ranked by session volume?
*/






/*
Would you be able to pull a list of the top entry pages? I want to confirm where our users are hitting the site. 
If you could pull all entry pages and rank them on entry volume, that would be great.
*/





/* 
The other day you showed us that all of our traffic is landing on the homepage right now. We should check how that landing page is performing. 
Can you pull bounce rates for traffic landing on the homepage? I would like to see three numbers…Sessions, Bounced Sessions, and % of Sessions which Bounced 
(aka “Bounce Rate”).
*/




/*
Based on your bounce rate analysis, we ran a new custom landing page (/lander-1) in a 50/50 test against the homepage (/home) for our gsearch nonbrand traffic. 
Can you pull bounce rates for the two groups so we can evaluate the new page? Make sure to just look at the time period where /lander-1 was getting traffic, so that it is a fair 
comparison
*/





/*
Could you pull the volume of paid search nonbrand traffic landing on /home and /lander-1, trended weekly since June 1st? I want to confirm the traffic is all routed correctly.
Could you also pull our overall paid search bounce rate trended weekly? I want to make sure the lander change has improved the overall picture.
*/





/*
I’d like to understand where we lose our gsearch visitors between the new /lander-1 page and placing an order. Can you build us a full conversion funnel, analyzing how many 
customers make it to each step? Start with /lander-1 and build the funnel all the way to our thank you page. Please use data since August 5th.
*/




/*
We tested an updated billing page based on your funnel analysis. Can you take a look and see whether /billing-2 is doing any better than the original /billing page? 
We’re wondering what % of sessions on those pages end up placing an order. FYI – we ran this test for all traffic, not just for our search visitors.
