Based on your conversion rate analysis, we bid down gsearch nonbrand on 2012-04-15. Can you pull gsearch nonbrand trended session volume, by week, to see if the bid 
changes have caused volume to drop at all?
*/





/*
I was trying to use our site on my mobile device the other day, and the experience was not great. Could you pull conversion rates from session to order, by device type?
If desktop performance is better than on mobile we may be able to bid up for desktop specifically to get more volume?
*/





/*
After your device-level analysis of conversion rates, we realized desktop was doing well, so we bid our gsearch nonbrand desktop campaigns up on 2012-05-19. 
Could you pull weekly trends for both desktop and mobile so we can see the impact on volume? You can use 2012-04-15 until the bid change as a baseline
